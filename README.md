# MGD-proteins-XAI

Dry eye disease is a prevalent condition that can be strongly painful for the patients. Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is the most common cause of dry eye disease. Composition of proteins in tears can reveal important information about the eye health. Several studies have investigated the change in tear proteomics during dry eye disease and MGD. In our work, we combine machine learning (ML) and methods from explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to detect proteins with potential clinical relevance for MGD.
